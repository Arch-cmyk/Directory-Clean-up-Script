# Directory-Clean-up-Script
Directory clean-up script using Python
The script when executed has to identify files based on their extensions and create a folder under the extension-name (groups same extension files together in the indicated directory).

run the file using the path;
python directory_clean.py --path ./test (where test is the directory in which the script makes changes)
